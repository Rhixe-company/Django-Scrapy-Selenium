          "description": "Mankind discovered the essence of the human soul, Edeya, and were achieving materialization.Society was built around Edeya, which was invulnerable to conventional weapons. Humanity started to place all their focus into the combat power of Edeya.Park Jinsung, the main character, possessed an F-rank soul and F-rank combat power. After the introduction of a poor military program to his high school and the Edeya rank system, Park Jinsung became one of the weak, and suffered under his peers' contempt for 10 years...However, in reality, the Edeya he had awakened was actually the S-rank \"Absolute Killing Intent\".Park Jinsung was greatly disturbed by the fact that the essence of his soul revolved around the thought of killing others, and continued to live his life while thinking of himself as a worthless F-rank.Will Park Jinsung, with a soul for killing, be able to get his killing intent under control and prove that there are no ranks to one's soul?",

In that martial clan, Lee Cheol was looked down on and chased out because of his status as an illegitimate child. In order to survive, he lived in shadows, but he was chased down and killed because of his family's schemes. He was then granted a second chance—regression. Using his \"ability to absorb the memories of a weapon\" as a foundation, Lee Cheol would train and go down a path of struggle. Persistent competition and schemes regarding the right to inheritance, attacks from other races and monsters in dangerous, unexplored lands, and even local clashes related to his family's internal struggles... His growth would bring about these things, bringing hardship upon Lee Cheol. Life itself would be a struggle for Lee Cheol, and this is his destiny. But in order to protect himself and his surroundings—in order to protect everything—as the fight continues, he'll unravel secrets from his past life, one by one...!",

Other than getting accepted into the Agent Military Academy, this character isn't particularly extraordinary, has no interactions with anyone in the novel, and isn’t even mentioned at all. Therefore, I became an extra in the novel....No. I became dust on the novel.",
