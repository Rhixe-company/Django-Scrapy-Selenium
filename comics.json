However, just as he entered the boss room, he saw a notification alerting him that he had cleared the tutorial and that he had possessed the body of the barbarian, Bjo Jandel, who was a playable character in the game. In the world of \"Dungeon and Stone\", only one city remained standing after the destruction of the world. A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a lower-class citizen. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life. With the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game...",

The otherworlders have more sophisticated technology and hunted down humans with combat robots and viral weapons, and the remaining humans battled on for 10 years just to survive. The main character, ‘Park Sung Hyun’, was the leader of the troops in Incheon, Bupyeong. Prior to the invasion of the Otherworlders, he used to be a part-timer at a convenience store like an ordinary person, but he became a strong warrior in the process of losing his family and battling to avenge them. In the midst of the attack against the Otherworlders headquarters, Park Hyun Sung got trapped in a warp portal with the leader. When he woke up, he found himself in a fantasy world that reminded him of the medieval times in Europe, and his soul was trapped inside a weak blonde 15-year-old pretty boy’s body. Hyun Sung was surprised by the unfamiliar surroundings and his weak body and found out that he is occupying the body of Ian Albarren, and that his father is the lord of a land who owes a large debt to the great lord and faces a difficult time ruling over his land. Park Hyun Sung, who had been fighting against combat robots and viral weaponry from the Otherworlders who had advanced scientific technology, decides to get used to this fantasy world to fight against monsters with armor and swords.\"]",

    "description": "10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as \"Hunters\". However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. Im someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the \"Worlds Weakest\". Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely eaed the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!",

Among them, there is a group known as the ‘twelve heroes’ who are the strongest. They are also the ones who built Eden and changed the world.
